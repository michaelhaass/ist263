    <body>
        My name is Michael Haass. I am a Real Estate & Entrepreneurship major and I am interested in commercial real estate. I worked for Cushman & Wakefield this past Summer, and come May, I will be a first-generation college graduate. I enjoy cooking, exercising, and I love movies and TV. I live on Long Island with my mom, my dad, my brother, and our dog.
